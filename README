I'm currently using this project to gain knowledge in git/ building a website & learning to use cypress.

To view the website you need to goto http://k10hrn.github.io/odin-recipes

<em>git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
cd repo
git branch gh-pages
# Might need to do this first: git branch -D gh-pages
git push -u origin gh-pages # Push the new branch back to github
Go to http://username.github.io/repo
