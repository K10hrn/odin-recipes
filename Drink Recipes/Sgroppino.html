    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces frozen lemon sorbet</li>
        <li>8 ounces Prosecco</li>
        <li>2 ounces vodka</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Scoop the sorbet into a large metal bowl. Add one-half of the Prosecco and whisk it around until you have a smooth icy mixture.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the vodka and remaining Prosecco. The cocktail should be very slushy.</li>
        <li>Pour into champagne flutes or other pretty glasses. Garnish with fresh mint and a few blueberries. Or, pour into jars and place them in the freezer until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
