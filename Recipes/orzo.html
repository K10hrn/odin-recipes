    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>This baked Vegan Orzo Recipe is an easy, throw it all in, one-pot wonder featuring tender orzo, cherry tomatoes
        & veggies topped with melty cheese!</p1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 cups (400 grams) cherry tomatoes, left whole</li>
        <li>1 large zucchini, diced (or roughly the same amount of any other easy cooking vegetable such as spinach,
            mushrooms, asparagus).</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste, puree in the UK</li>
        <li>3 cups water, or half water half white wine</li>
        <li>2½ cups (1lb / 453 grams) uncooked orzo, or gluten-free orzo</li>
        <li>1 big handful fresh basil, chopped (or 2 teaspoons dried basil)</li>
        <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon chili flakes, optional</li>
        <li>2½ teaspoons sea salt, if using table salt adjust as necessary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1½ to 2 cups (180 - 240 grams) shredded vegan cheese, that melts well</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450F (230°C)</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, whole cherry tomatoes, and zucchini (or other chopped veg) to a 9 x
            13-inch
            or similar oven-proof dish. (Unless you are using frozen peas or a leafy vegetable like spinach. Leave those
            out for now. )Toss together to coat with oil, then cook uncovered in the oven for 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>To the vegetables add the tomato paste and the water and stir to combine and break up the tomato paste. Then
            throw in the orzo (raw), basil, chili flakes, salt, pepper, and any leafy vegetables/peas if using, then
            give it all good stir, making sure the orzo is all submerged.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly with a lid, foil, or an upturned baking tray and bake for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover, sprinkle over lots of vegan cheese, cover again (to help the cheese melt) and bake for a further 10
            minutes. If you have a water spray bottle, spray a few sprays of water over the cheese before covering. The
            steam will help it melt.</li>
        <li>Take off the lid and broil for a couple of minutes until the top is bubbly and golden. Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Store leftover vegan orzo in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. It's great for reheating
            in a microwave or covered in an oven.</li>
    </ul>
