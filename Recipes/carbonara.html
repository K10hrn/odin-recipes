    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>This 20-minute pasta recipe is so easy to whip together. A simple creamy sauce coats the noodles with chewy,
        salty, smoky, bites of sun-dried tomato. Perfect for a busy weeknight meal, made from ingredients you probably
        already have in the pantry.
    </p1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 400 g pasta of choice (spaghetti, fettucini, bucantini, or gluten-free if preferred)</li>
        <li>½ cup sun-dried tomatoes (the dry kind, not in oil), sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon liquid smoke</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour (gluten-free if preferred)</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups plant-based milk (such as soy or almond)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon black salt (also called kala namak), use regular salt if preferred</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package directions.</li>
        <li>Mix together the sun-dried tomatoes, soy sauce, and liquid smoke in a small bowl and set aside to absorb the
            flavours while you prepare the rest of the dish.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. When hot add the onions and garlic and sauté until
            the onion turns translucent and begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle over the flour and stir to coat
            the onions, let cook for about 60 seconds, then whisk in all of the remaining ingredients. Cook the sauce
            for about 5 minutes until thickened, whisking as needed. If the sauce gets too thick, add a splash more
            plant-based milk, and if the sauce is too thin, simply cook it longer.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta and the marinated sun-dried tomatoes to the sauce and toss well to combine. Serve hot.
            Garnish with parsley and parmesan if desired.</li>
    </ol>
